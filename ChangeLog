	* trunk/extragear/libs/libkipi/libkipi/batchprogressdialog.cpp,

	* trunk/extragear/libs/libkipi/libkipi/Makefile.am: libkipi: List
	  _all_ libs in _LDADD from which libkipi needs symbols:

	  $(LIB_KIO) $(LIB_KDEUI) $(LIB_KDECORE) $(LIB_QT) OT ;) at least
	  for linux and shared libs the LIB_QT var (== -lqt-mt $(LIBZ)
	  $(LIBPNG) -lXext $(LIB_X11) $(LIBSM) -lpthread) is better
	  replaced by -lqt-mt. Otherwise the loader adds 20 additional
	  libraries as NEEDED to libkipi. CCMail:digikam-devel@kde.org

	  its dangerous to make an assumption of a passed arg being null,
	  when its being called    from multiple places in different modes.
	  better use a separate explicit variable to	indicate that the
	  function is being called in a different mode. good for the sanity
	  of those reading the code as well	BUG: 94370

	  The plugin loader does now offer a configuration widget, for
	  configuring which plugins should be loaded.

	  To configure simply call PluginLoader::configWidget(), this will
	  return a widget you can add to your normal configuration dialog.

	  When done configuring you must call the apply() slot of the
	  config widget.

	  To get the above working, you must now connect to
	  PluginLoader::plug()/unplug() signals both bringing a
	  PluginLoader::Info struct telling which plugin to (un)plug.

	  Alternatively, if you want to do all in one batch, you can
	  connect to PluginLoader::replug().

	  See the reference page for the plugin loader for a hint on how to
	  plug/unplug plugins the easiest way.

	* libkipi/: imagecollection.cpp, interface.cpp, interface.h:

	  - I realized that most of the plugins had code looking like this:
	      ImageCollection images = interface->currentSelection();
	  if ( !images.isValid() )	 images =
	  interface->currentAlbum();   I therefore added a function called
	  currentScope(), which does exactly   this. Its implementation is
	  as simple as	   KIPI::ImageCollection
	  KIPI::Interface::currentScope()     {       ImageCollection
	  images = currentSelection();	     if ( images.isValid() )
	     return images;	  else		 return currentAlbum();
	   }

	  - Added signals to KIPI::Interface. The host application may now
	  emit one   of     void selectionChanged( bool hasSelection );
	  void currentAlbumChanged( bool anyAlbum );   in addition the
	  interface will itself emit	 void currentScopeChanged( bool
	  asScope );   when one of the others are emitted.

	  - Added all the, till now, commented out lines for
	  enabling/disabling   actions based on selection/album

	  kde-imaging@kde.org clean up of the PluginLoader class as

	  PluginLoader is now typedefed to typedef QValueList<Info> List;

	  Where info is defined as this: struct Info {	   Info( const

	  Added ImageCollection::isValid().  I realized that there was no
	  way for applications like digikam to indicate that there were no
	  album selected. So to indicate that an image collection is
	  invalid, the host application should give 0 for
	  ImageCollectionShared pointer on construction of ImageCollection.
	   This will make ImageCollection::isValid() return false.  Plugins
	  should now test for isValid() before using data from image
	  collection.

	* libkipi/: interface.cpp, plugin.cpp, plugin.h: CCMAIL:
	  kde-imaging@kde.org, dfaure@kde.org

	  Together with David Faure I did yesterday make the necessary
	  changes to allow icons local to each plugin.

	  The basic point of all this was that the
	  KIPI::Plugin::actionCollection() needed to know about the plugins
	  KInstance - as it was till this change, it got the KInstance for
	  the host application, and would thus look for icons in the host
	  applications directory.

	  Making this change did, however, reveal a conflict, namely that
	  each and every action in the plugin must have the
	  actionCollection as parent - which was not the case for items in
	  KMenuActions.

	  The way the host application finds actions right now is by
	  querying the actionCollection(), which with the above change
	  would also reveal those actions from menus.

	  I therefore needed to add another way for the host application to
	  get information about actions. I added a method called
	  KIPI::Plugin::actions() which the host application must call to
	  get information about actions. At the same time I made the
	  actionCollection() method protected, so the host application
	  can't get to that anymore.

	  To tell KIPI about actions, then plugins must now call
	  KIPI::Plugin::addAction() on each action they want to be in the
	  topmost menu (thus not actions located in KActionMenu's).

	  Let me summerize the changes - Host application now need to call
	  actions() rather than   actionCollection() to get information
	  about action in the plugin.  - plugins now need to give a pointer
	  to KGenericFactory<..>::instance() in   the constructor of the
	  Plugin superclass.  - the plugin must call addAction() for each
	  toplevel action.

	  And now to answer the question on how to get local icons.  In
	  Makefile.am, you need a line similar to this:
	  kipibatchprocessimagesicondir =
	  $(kde_datadir)/kipiplugin_batchprocessimages/icons

	  The name specified above (the "kipiplugin_batchprocessimages"),
	  must be the same as what you specify to KGenericFactory in the
	  plugin:

	  typedef KGenericFactory<Plugin_BatchProcessImages> Factory;
	  K_EXPORT_COMPONENT_FACTORY( kipiplugin_batchprocessimages,
			       Factory("kipiplugin_batchprocessimages"));

	  - added KIPI::Interface::delImage(), so plugins can tell the app
	  when an   image has been removed.  - Added
	  KIPI::Features::ImageTitlesWritable so that plugin can disable
	  editing the title of an image if that doesn't make any sense for
	  the host   app.  - Added ImageInfo::cloneData( const ImageInfo&
	  other ), as an easy way for	plugins to copy data from one image
	  to another, and also to allow the host   application to copy any
	  info not available through the API.  - renamed ImageInfo::name()
	  and ImageInfo::setName() to title() and   setTitle(), and at the
	  same time added a default implementation to	ImageInfoShared for
	  these two methods.

	  plugin).

	  The upload widget is a directory browser knowing about KURL's.
	  To let the browser start somewhere, I've added a new method
	  ImageCollection::uploadRoot.

	  This isn't 100% complete yet, but I want to show it to Aurelien

	  The acquireimage plugin has been changed to used this new class.

	* libkipi/: imagecollection.cpp, imagecollection.h,
	  imagecollectionshared.cpp, imagecollectionshared.h,
	  interface.cpp, interface.h: CCMAIL: kde-imaging@kde.org As a
	  conclusion to the path issues I've now implemented the following
	  changes in libkipi:

	  In ImageCollection added path() and uploadPath() These two
	  function must of course be implemented in the inherited version
	  of ImageCollectionShared, but a default implementation is given
	  if you do not care.

	  path() should return a path for the images. If that does not make
	  sense the host application may return a common root or even an
	  empty URL. The plugins are in the documentation of the method
	  suggested to look at the feature KIPI::AlbumEQDir before
	  expecting that the path is the path of the album.

	  uploadPath() specifies a directory to place new images. By
	  placing this method in this class, it makes it possible for host
	  application with Dir==Album to place new images in these albums,
	  and other application may choose to place new images on common
	  roots or even in one static directory.

	  A new KIPI::Features has been added, namely AcceptNewImages,
	  which tells the plugin if the image accept new images at all.
	  Plugins should never call uploadPath() of this feature is not
	  present. Likewise if this feature is present, the host
	  application must implement the uploadPath() method.

	  In KIPI::Interface a new method has been created, namely
	  addImage( KURL ), with which the plugin must tell the host
	  application about new images.

	  and KIPI::SupportsDateRanges (See documentation of the enums for
	  their meaning)

	  Changed ImageInfo::time() to ImageInfo::time( TimeSpec spec =
	  FromInfo ) this change did of course propogate to
	  ImageInfoShared, so host apps needs to update.

	  If your app do not support time ranges (like an image is from
	  1998-2000), then just return the time as always ignoring the spec
	  argument.  Still you do need to update your app to override the
	  correct virtual method.

	  Added ImageInfo::setTime() and ImageInfoShared::setTime()

	  Added ImageInfo::isExactTime() and ImageInfoShared::isExactTime()
	  to tell whether an image has an exact time or a time range. The
	  default implementation is to return true, so unless your app
	  supports time ranges, you can ignore this method.

2004-04-25 20:19  gateau

	* libkipi/: imagecollection.cpp, imagecollectionshared.h: No more
	  'root()' method

2004-04-25 19:26  blackie

	* libkipi/imagecollectionshared.h: removed constness

2004-04-25 19:01  blackie

	* libkipi/: KDStream.h, imagecollection.h, imagecollectionshared.h,
	  imageinfo.h, imageinfoshared.h, pluginloader.h, thumbnailjob.h:
	  prefixed all header protections with KIPI_

2004-04-25 17:58  blackie

	* libkipi/: KDStream.cpp, plugin.h: added an id() to the plugin
	  class, so it is possible to write code in the host apps for
	  handling certain plugins special. I'd for example like to put the
	  print plugin in teh file menu

2004-04-25 17:41  blackie

	* libkipi/: KDStream.cpp, Makefile.am, imagecollection.cpp,
	  imagecollection.h, imagecollectionshared.cpp,
	  imagecollectionshared.h, imageinfo.cpp, imageinfo.h, interface.h:
	  added reference counting to ImageCollection

	* libkipi/: imageinfo.cpp, imageinfo.h, imageinfoshared.h: Fixed
	  typo: descrion -> description

2004-04-25 16:42  blackie

	* libkipi/: Makefile.am, imageinfo.cpp, imageinfo.h,
	  imageinfoshared.cpp, imageinfoshared.h, pluginloader.h: added
	  reference counting to ImageInfo

2004-04-25 15:26  blackie

	* libkipi/plugin.h: made it all compile without a make install
	  inbetween

2004-04-24 20:20  blackie

	* libkipi/: design, imagecollection.cpp, imagecollection.h,
	  imageinfo.h, interface.h: more porting, now added all plugins
	  except two that Renchi wants to work more on before they are
	  being ported. Note that not all added plugins has yet been
	  ported, if a directory is not in Makefile.am, then it has not yet
	  been ported. I have, however, done some general porting on all
	  directories.

	* libkipi/: Makefile.am, imagecollection.cpp, imagecollection.h,
	  interface.cpp, interface.h, thumbnailjob.cpp, thumbnailjob.h:
	  started porting digikam plugins

	* libkipi/imageinfo.h: unbreak compilation

2004-04-09 01:15  gateau

	* libkipi/interface.cpp: includemoc

2004-04-04 19:34  gateau

	* .cvsignore, libkipi/Makefile.am: - Fixed compilation (include
	  dirs, tabs vs spaces in Makefile.am) - Added a few entries in
	  .cvsignore

2004-03-30 09:21  blackie

	* Makefile.am, libkipi/Makefile.am, libkipi/interface.cpp,
	  libkipi/interface.h, libkipi/plugin.cpp, libkipi/plugin.h,
	  libkipi/pluginloader.cpp, libkipi/pluginloader.h: added an
	  example plugin (helloworld), plus an example application using
	  the lib (kipidemo)

2004-03-29 19:32  blackie

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore.

	  And for those of you reading cvs logs: libkipi is an attempt at
	  getting a common plugin structure for a bunch of image
	  applications. Currently the following applications participate in
	  the work: digikam, gwenview, showimg, and KimDaBa.
